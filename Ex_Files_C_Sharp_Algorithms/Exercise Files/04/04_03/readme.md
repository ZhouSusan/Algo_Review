Challenge: Print out the first N binary numbers.

A binary number is a number that consists of ones and zeros, and it's on the base-2 numerical system.

Example:

The algorithm we create should generate as many of these numbers as we specify.
If the input was 8, then the algorithm should print out one, one zero, one one, one zero zero, etc.
If the input is less than or equal to zero, the algorithm should print out nothing.

Input: N = 8  
Output:

        1
        10
        11
        100
        101
        110
        111
        1000
