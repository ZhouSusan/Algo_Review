Bubble Sort

* Bubble sort begins by comparing the first two elements to each other to see which is larger. If the first element is larger than the second, then the two elements are swapped. 
* Then the algorithm advances to the next slot and performs the same comparison and again, swaps the values if the first one is larger than the second. 
* This process continues until all the items in the array are examined, and the largest value has made its way to the end. 
* Then the process then starts all over again, but now, we only examine the elements up to the one before the last item and then the one before that and so on, until the array is fully sorted.
