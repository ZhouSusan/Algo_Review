Example: Euclid's Algorithm 

* Find the greatest common denominator(GCD) of two integers.
* For two integers a and b, where a > b, divide a by b.
* If the remainder, r, is 0, then stop: GCD is b. 
* Otherwise, set a to b, b to r, and repeat at step 1 until r is zero.

Example: GCD of 20 and 8 is 4
(because 8/4 is 2; and 20/4 is 5)
