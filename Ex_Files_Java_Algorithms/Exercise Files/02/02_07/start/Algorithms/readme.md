Challenge: Rotate array

Challenge: Create an algorithm that rotates the contents of an array to left by one space.

Example:

Input: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}

Output: {2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1}

This rotation should be done in place. A new array should not be created. 

Bonus: Create an algorithm that rotates the array's contents to the right.
