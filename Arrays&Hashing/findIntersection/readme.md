## [Find Intersection](https://gigster.coderbyte.com/editor/Find%20Intersection:Java)

Have the function `findIntersection(strArr)` read the array of strings stored in strArr which will contain 2 elements: 
the first element will represent a list of comma-separated numbers sorted in ascending order, 
the second element will represent a second list of comma-separated numbers (also sorted). 

Your goal is to return a comma-separated string containing the numbers that occur in elements of `strArr` in sorted order. 
If there is no intersection, return the string false.

**Examples:** 
````
Input: new String[] {"1, 3, 4, 7, 13", "1, 2, 4, 13, 15"}
Output: 1,4,13
````

````
Input: new String[] {"1, 3, 9, 10, 17, 18", "1, 4, 9, 10"}
Output: 1,9,10
