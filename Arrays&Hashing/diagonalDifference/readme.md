## [Diagonal Difference](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/diagonal-difference/problem)

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

**Example**:
````
[
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [9, 8, 9]
]  

The left-to-right diagonal = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15. 
The right to left diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17. 
Their absolute difference is |15 - 17| = 2.
